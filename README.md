# My Beat-Selling Website

PLEASE NOTE, THIS IS NOT A FINISHED PROJECT.

[Checkout the website here](https://vincemaina.herokuapp.com/)

Goals:
- [x] Automate the repetive aspects of my beat-selling business
  - [x] Adding product listings on my website for each beat (SOLUTION: This website creates a new product listing automatically when I upload a new video, so all I have to do is upload the beat on youtube.)
  - [x] Sorting out a custom lease agreement contract for every sale. (SOLUTION: This uses forms and Google APIs to produce a PDF agreement and send it to the customer.)
