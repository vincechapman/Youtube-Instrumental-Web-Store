This module contains all functionality that deals with the YouTube API and other youtube assets, such as the audio urls we extract using pafy.

This application currently uses a modified version of pafy, as the main module has not be updated to reflect YouTube's removal of the dislike button - which is causing pafy to throw an error unless corrected.

If pafy do get round to correcting this issue, go back to using the standard pafy download, as it's possible this verion of the code may become outdated.
